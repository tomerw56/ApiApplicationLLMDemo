Here is the expanded `GetClientTransactionRequest` message with a color selection:

```xml
<Message name="GetClientTransactionRequest">
	<ClientId type="int" />
	<CarColor type="Color" /> <!-- added CarColor field -->
</Message>
```

Note: I added a new `<CarColor>` field to the `GetClientTransactionRequest` message, which will allow clients to specify the color of the cars they are interested in seeing transactions for. The `type` attribute is set to `"Color"` to match the existing `CarColor` type defined earlier in the API definition.
